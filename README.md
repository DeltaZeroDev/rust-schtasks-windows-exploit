# rust-schtasks-windows-exploit
rust code that runs a windows exploit that gains system privs in a cmd prompt, can pair this with the fodhelper exploit I uploaded to get full access to a pc

THIS IS ILLEGAL TO USE MALICIOUSLY, PLEASE DO NOT USE MALICIOUSLY. IF YOU RUN THIS, IT WILL LAG YOUR PC AND GAIN SYSTEM PERMS ON A CMD, NOTHING ELSE
